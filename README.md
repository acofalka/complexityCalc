# Complexity calculator

Estimates complexity of given algorithm.

Input
Class containing 3 methods:
  - init_fun - things that must be done before the algrithm starts
  - fun - the algorithm of which complexity will be estimated
  - cleaner - things that must be done after the algorithm ends
  
 Output:
  - estimated complexity - one of following: O(n), O(n^2), O(n^3), O(log n), O(n*log(n)), O(1)
  - function time(number_of_elements)
  - function number_of_elements(time)
  - graph of function time(number_of_elements)
